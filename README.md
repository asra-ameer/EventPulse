# Real-Time Event Ticketing System

## Introduction
The Real-Time Event Ticketing System is a dynamic, high-performance application for managing ticket releases and purchases in real-time. The system ensures data integrity through multi-threading and synchronization, supporting the following features:
- Setting maximum ticket limits for events and ticket pools.
- Adding vendors to release tickets and customers to purchase them at configurable rates.
- Monitoring ticket availability and sales.
- Stopping and resetting the system dynamically.
